  <h2>Main Section!</h2>
  <p>In many situations, you’d want to use Ajax-load-more or filters to dynamically display content on a page, so a 
    grid-layout would be needed.

    For example, as part of our web presence overhaul for {code}, Open Source at Dell Technologies, we created a page for 
    dynamically displaying posts based on filter and sorting options.

    Projects can be viewed through page filtering or sorting.
    
    We created a grid layout so that posts could easily be appended without breaking the layout. In this tutorial, you’ll 
    learn how to re-create this post grid.
    Creating the responsive grid
    
  
    All of our grid-items (columns) are wrapped with one row and one container.
    
    
    Our container CSS sets the total max-width. Using display: flex, our grid-row stretches to the full size of the container.
    
    We use flex-flow: wrap to designate that child divs (our columns/grid-items) should wrap if they exceed the width of the row. 
    Then, flex-flow: row means our grid-items will flex from left to right. If we used flex-flow: column, our child divs would 
    flex from top down.
    
    
    Then, we use justify-content: flex-start because we want our grid-items to line up next to each-other at the start of the row.
    Creating the grid item
    
    Each grid-item should have identical height, so we set a height of 550px:
    
    On desktop views, we set a flex-basis of 20% for each grid-item. This means that 5 grid-items will display on the same level.
    The 6th grid-item will wrap to the next “row” since we are using flex-wrap: wrap in our grid-row.
 
    We only need a few media queries on our .grid-item. We just need to define the flex-basis on each desired screen-width.
    
    Based on the content within our grid-items, we used these media queries:
    
    On the smallest screen-width, we use a flex-basis of 100% to make our grid-item the full-width of the grid-row.
    
    With either approach, we only need to change the flex-basis for a few screen-widths to achieve a grid.
